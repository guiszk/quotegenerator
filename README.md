# quotegenerator
Generate semi-intelligible quotes from a text file.

## about
This script selects a random word from a file, looks for it in a different line and appends the word that succeeds it, resulting in sentences that make more sense syntactically than grammatically.

## usage
First, install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python quotegenerator.py <text file>`

## examples
These use adventure time dialogue lines as input.

`Don't you were the eyeballs coming from my cheeks? Feeling a bag pretty sweet.`

`Tell me something I've been under siege by tearing us out for your paws'll fit through the acoustics out souls in jail is it? A key! A smoothie like there's little goblin will ya? Tuck-ety tuck! Let's just tell me?! Please say so.`

`I'm so scared to escape when you're gonna gaze into here.`

`Adventure with him back in the deal, screwy?! Why not? Come here, lady, no idea.`
